# JavaScript DOM Manipulation from FreeCodeCamp's YouTube Channel

## 1. What is the DOM?

    - Document Object Model
    - Use it to Manipulate Content, Style and Structure
    - Is one of the most unique and useful tools of JavaScript
  
## 2. Manipulating the DOM

For us to manipulate Elements using the DOM, we need to fist be able to select them in JavaScript.
This is done mainly by using methods such as getElementById and querySelector.
The usual way to work with elements like this is assigning them to variables (const, let)

## 3. Traversing the DOM

To traverse the DOM means to move up and down the HTML Document Tree.
Once we have our elements assigned to variables, we can them use methods to interact with its parent or children.

## 4. Event Listeners

Event listeners are the main responsible in adding interaction with the elements being displayed

## 5. Event Propagation 

3 Phases:
    1. Event Capturing
    2. Target
    3. Event Bubbling
   
## 6. Event Delegation

It allows users to append a SINGLE event listener to a parent element that adds it to all of its present AND future descendants  that match a selector
